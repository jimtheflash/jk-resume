## Summary
Hello! I'm a data science leader with 15 years of experience building and leading teams to translate data into actionable insights and tools for product, marketing, and senior management teams. I have lots of experience designing and scaling tools for experimentation and reporting, and leveraging AI to accelerate development.

My ideal role is at a growing e-commerce or marketplace platform, where I can play a key part in driving data strategy, developing and mentoring teams of data scientists and analysts, crafting and sharing data-backed narratives (often supported by data from A/B tests), and collaborating with colleagues to make better decisions.
